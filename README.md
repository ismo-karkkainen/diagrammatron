# Diagrammatron

This is a small collection to programs to do three things:
- Place the nodes of a graph/diagram onto a plane.
- Place edges between the nodes.
- Turn the resulting graph into a graphics file for viewing.

All stages are separate programs. Input file can contain information for
later stages as each stage only considers the part it needs and other
information is passed through as is.
